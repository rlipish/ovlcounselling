              <h3>Authenticity, Connection, Compassion</h3>
              <p>Hi I’m Ory! I am passionate about mental health and empowering people to live an authentic life, aligned with their values.</p>
              <p>
                The human experience is unique and complex. It can be overwhelming, and you may be feeling “stuck” with self-doubt, anxiety, interpersonal difficulties, parenting challenges, or life transitions. Is it negatively impacting your daily functioning?
              </p>
              <p>
                Are you tired of going through the motions of daily life and ready to make a change?</p>

              <p>You are all you need to start the change process!
              </p>

              <p>I provide a non-judgmental and empathic space where you can process your thoughts and feelings, gain insight, and take actions to get “unstuck”.</p>
              <p>
                Together we will explore your values, examine your patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviours, and utilize interventions informed by Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT), Attachment Theory and Family Systems Theory.

              </p>
              <p>
                Through this process, we will discover your strengths and abilities, focus on self-compassion, as well as explore what may be holding you back from living a meaningful life aligned with your values.</p>

              <p>When your values are clear, the human experience becomes less overwhelming and life choices and decisions become easier to make.
              </p>

              <p style="color:#258cd1;font-size:0.9rem">“Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and freedom.” – Victor Frankl</p>

              <h3>About Me</h3>
              <p>
                I am a Registered Social Worker based in Calgary, Alberta.</p>

<p>As a working mom, daughter, sister, and wife, I know how it feels to be exhausted to the bones, to serve others day in and day out, prioritizing their needs before mine until it becomes unsustainable. </p>

<p>I learnt to accept the things outside of my personal control and commit to actions that would improve my life. The fascinating thing is that the more I focused on nonjudgmentally taking care of my needs, listening to the needs of my body, the more energy I had and the more present I was in my relationships. I was better able to model emotion regulation, normalize self compassion, and appreciate the positive impacts my setting boundaries helped my little ones (and let’s be honest, even my “big” ones) become more self-sufficient and confident in their abilities.
              </p>

              <p> Having over 10 years of experience working with children, youth, adults, and families in the areas of mental health and addiction, I have worked with individuals from diverse backgrounds and intersecting identities in their homes and in the community. The resilient and life improvements I see in the individuals I work alongside fuels my passion for mental health.   </p>
              
<p>I am committed to helping you in your journey to empower yourself, clarify your values, and find motivation to achieve your value-based goals.</p>

<p>For those who are curious about my credentials, I have a:</p>
<p>Master of Social Work in Clinical Social Work Practice (University of Calgary)</p>
<p>Bachelor of Social Work (University of Victoria)</p>
<p>Bachelor of Science in Psychology (University of Calgary)</p>
                <!-- <p> My therapeutic style draws from Attachment Theory, Family Therapy, Cognitive Behaviour
                  Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT), and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
                  (ACT).</p> -->
